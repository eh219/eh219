- Brief: Plants species thrive within an ecological niche comprising several abiotic factors, but these
ecological niches will be affected as the climate continues to change. This leads to my question,
how will plant species ranges be involved in the face of climate change? Our objective is to provide a tool 
for future researchers to utilize in order to create prediction models allowing the creation of actionable plans for conservationists.
